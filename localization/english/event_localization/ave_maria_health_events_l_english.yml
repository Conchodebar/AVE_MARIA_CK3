The hydrothermal springs here in Pythia feed bathhouses said to have been constructed by Constantine the Great himself. Once the commoners have been removed, I soak in the baths within the Caldarium for a while, allowing the heat to permiate my skin. I then proceed into the Laconicum, where the hottest steam fills my lungs, purging the illness within me. The ancient waters have healed many ailments over time, and now I can feel these restorative effects myself."
