### Table of content
## Introduction
## The multiple entries exist due to title flavorization limitation, (ie it is not possible to name rulers "Kourator" or "Doux" based on their vassal contract type) 
## Each specific contract type has thus its own government to be able to be named differently in game
## Functionality wise they are similar, differences lie in the vassal contracts.
